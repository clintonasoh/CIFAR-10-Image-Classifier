# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier 

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to build a neural network to evaluate the CIFAR-10 dataset, a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. The goal is to achieve an accuracy greater than 45%, with an optional target of surpassing 70% to outperform Detectocorp's algorithm.

Some benchmark results on CIFAR-10 achieved by various models are provided as reference points for performance comparison.

## Recommendation
Based on the evaluation results, here are the key points for making a recommendation:

1. **Comparison with Detectocorp's model**: Our model's accuracy of 47.324% surpasses Detectocorp's 45%, indicating an improvement.

2. **Comparison with advanced literature solutions**: Despite the improvement, our model falls short compared to highly advanced solutions in the literature achieving accuracies well above 70%. To better compare with these models, significant enhancements are required.

3. **Approach for improvement**: Initially, a basic CNN architecture was implemented, which yielded low accuracy. Subsequent modifications including adding more layers and adjusting training parameters led to incremental improvements. However, further enhancements such as deeper CNN architectures, longer training epochs, and the incorporation of dropout layers are necessary for substantial accuracy improvement.

4. **Necessity for improvement**: Given the current accuracy, there is a clear need for improvement. Enhancing the model's accuracy would involve significant effort in refining the architecture, optimizing hyperparameters, and potentially exploring advanced techniques in the field.

Considering these factors, the recommendation leans towards building rather than buying a solution. Achieving accuracy comparable to advanced models in the literature would require substantial resources in terms of manpower and finances, making it more practical to invest in developing an in-house solution tailored to specific requirements.
